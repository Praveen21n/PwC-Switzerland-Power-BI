### **Project Execution**  
The project was divided into several stages, each requiring the use of **Power BI, SQL, and Excel** for data analysis and visualization. Below is a breakdown of each stage:  

#### **1. Understanding the Data**  
The dataset provided in the simulation contained **HR data**, including details on employees' gender, age, tenure, position level, and other workforce-related attributes. The first step was to **explore the dataset**, clean it if necessary, and understand the key variables that influence gender diversity at the executive level.  

#### **2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
Before proceeding with the analysis, the data had to be **cleaned and structured** to ensure accuracy and consistency. The key tasks included:  
- Handling missing values and inconsistencies in gender classifications.  
- Standardizing job titles and position levels for accurate comparisons.  
- Filtering out irrelevant data that could skew the analysis.  

#### **3. Creating Power BI Dashboards**  
Once the data was cleaned and structured, Power BI was used to develop **interactive dashboards** that visually represented key findings. The dashboards focused on the following aspects:  
- **Gender Distribution Across Job Levels:** A breakdown of male and female employees at different levels within the company.  
- **Executive Gender Balance Analysis:** A comparison of gender representation at the executive management level vs. lower levels.  
- **Trend Analysis Over Time:** A historical analysis showing changes in gender diversity over the years.  
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Metrics highlighting disparities, such as the percentage of women in leadership roles and the average tenure of male vs. female employees at senior levels.  
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Insights into factors contributing to gender imbalances, such as promotion trends and employee retention rates.  

#### **4. Insight Generation and Problem-Solving**  
Using the **visualizations and data trends**, the next step was to **interpret the findings** and draw meaningful conclusions. Key insights included:  
- A **significant gender imbalance** at the executive management level despite a relatively balanced workforce at lower levels.  
- Women in the organization having **longer tenures before promotion** compared to their male counterparts.  
- A noticeable **drop-off rate for female employees** after reaching mid-management positions, indicating potential barriers to career advancement.  
- Gender-based salary and promotion gaps that contributed to the disparities observed at senior levels.  

#### **5. Crafting Actionable Recommendations**  
Based on the analysis, a set of **recommendations** was formulated to help improve gender diversity at the executive level:  
- Implement **mentorship and leadership programs** to support career progression for female employees.  
- Introduce **transparent promotion criteria** to ensure equal opportunities for advancement.  
- Conduct **bias training** for management to address potential unconscious biases in hiring and promotion decisions.  
- Develop **retention strategies** to reduce the drop-off rate of female employees at mid-management levels.  

#### **6. Communicating Findings**  
One of the critical components of the simulation was **effective communication**. After completing the analysis, a professional and concise **email summary** was drafted for the engagement partners at PwC. The email included:  
- A high-level summary of key findings.  
- The most critical insights from the Power BI dashboards.  
- Actionable recommendations based on the data.  
- A call to action for further discussions or deeper analysis if needed.
